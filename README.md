This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in React Native: rendering a component before it's fully defined or mounted. The `Bug.js` file illustrates the problem where an attempt is made to render a component that hasn't fully loaded. The `BugSolution.js` file presents a solution using component lifecycle methods and conditional rendering to ensure that the components are rendered correctly after they have fully loaded. This approach helps prevent unexpected behavior and improves the stability of your application. The problem is particularly relevant when dealing with asynchronous operations and components with complex dependencies.
